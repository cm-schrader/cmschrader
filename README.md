# cmschrader.com
This repository is my personal portfolio website [cmschrader.com](https://cmschrader.com).  
It contains a variety of info on my skills and past experiences.  The page is written entirely 
pure HTML and CSS.  While not the most flexible of formats, this was quick to develop and 
makes for a very light weight cite.  It is purely static as required by Github Pages, the 
service used to host it.
