        <p>
            Modern programing projects typically involve large code bases where
            multiple subsystems interact to manage complex functions and large
            amounts of data. This makes it impossible for one programmer to work
            on it alone. Software engineering is the practice of planing,
            managing, and programing these systems, typically as part of a team.
            Software engineers utilize design patterns and write program APIs to
            enable cooperation between subsystems. They use development
            methodologies, such as Agile, to ensure their system meets
            requirements and is delivered on time all while working effectively
            with teammates. These skills are what differentiates a software
            engineer capable of contributing to projects in industry from
            someone who just knows how to program.

        <h3>Agile</h3>
        <p>
            Agile is a software engineering methodology commonly used in
            industry. It revolves around small self-contained teams that work
            together to manage requirements, planing, and development. A key
            feature of Agile is that it mandates frequent iterations. An Agile
            team aims to always have a functional application that could be
            deployed. These features allow Agile teams to adapt to changing
            requirements and quickly react to setbacks. I learned how to operate
            as a member of an Agile team in my Software Engineering course. In
            this course I learned Unified Modeling Language (UML), software
            design patterns, git, and software management.

        <h3>DocTour</h3>
        <p>
            The Software Engineering course featured a large term project,
            completed by 10 person groups utilizing Agile Scrum, a specific type
            of Agile. We were tasked to develop a directory and request
            management system for Brigham and Women's Hospital in Worcester. To
            add to the challenge, all WPI courses went virtual due to the
            Covid-19 pandemic. Over the course of four iterations, our team
            wrote 21,120 lines of Java, managed testing and continuous
            integration, and wrote documentation. We presented several times
            including a final presentation to Brigham and Women's executives and
            staff. Additionally, we won best program of the second iteration.

            While the program itself exceeds the download size limits of my
            hosting service, I am able to provide the user guide which can be
            downloaded from the link below.
