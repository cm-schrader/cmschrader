                <h3>Rapid Prototyping</h3>
                <p>Ever since learning 3D printing in high school, I've been using it for projects and prototyping.
                    Designing for manufacturability is key. I also have experience with CNC milling and laser cutting

                <p>Designing aerospace systems requires attention to detail. Over a many projects, I've learned to
                    manage specifics like tolerances and material properties within an itterative design process.

                <p>Similar to model rocketry, high power rocketry involves the design, construction, and flight of a
                    rocket.
                    High power rocketry involves higher impulse rocket motors and requires certifications. The
                    engineering skills involved are aplicable to many other areas.</p>

                <p>Through the application of my engineering and software skills, I found that I needed to learn
                    electrical
                    engineering to connect them. My experience is focused on using microcontrollers, most recently the
                    STM32.</p>

                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>As my first programing language, I've been coding in Python since 2016. With my strong familiarity of
                    it's syntax, functionality, and best practices, I've written quick scripts and desktop applications.
                    Python's fast prototyping speed and numerous scientific and mathematical libraries make it a good
                    choice for many enginering applications.

                <h3>C/C++</h3>
                <p>C is the de facto language for embedded and high performace programs. The abcence of guard rails
                    nececitates a strong understanding of C concepts such as memory managment and pointers as well as
                    objects in C++. I've applied these skills to a variety of applications such as solving the knapsack
                    problem and writing the firmware for a heat seeking robot.</p>

                <p>Agile is a software development methodology commonly used in industry. An Agile team focuses on
                    always having a working program and accomplishing specific goals over short sprints. My experience
                    with Agile makes it essier to work witha team to develop large programs.</p>

                        system requirments is integral to success. I have experience managing both individual and large

                        technical writing. The large amount of papers I've written has developed my ability to write

                        solved
                        many
                        problems that were beyond my skill set at the time by learning from books, internet sources, and
                        peers.

                        primarily rocket and spacecraft simulation projects. I've worked with MATLAB's ODE solvers,
                        Aerospace and Controls toolboxes, and a little bit of object oriented programing.</p>

                        I've learned to
                        make good use of themes to create consistent formats and automatic tabeles of contents and
                        figures.
