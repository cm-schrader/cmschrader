                <p>
                    GNC is a subfield within aerospace concerned with predicting and controlling vehicle dynamics.
                      I've used powerful analytical and computational tools
                    to build things like aircraft state estimators and rocket flight control systems.

                <p>
                    Complex projects like spacecraft need to combine multiple subsystems to meet requirements
                    while staying below constraints.  Having done systems engineering work on a variety of projects,
                    I've learned what goes into managing the small parts to create the big picture.

                <p>Ever since learning 3D printing in high school, I've been using it for projects and prototyping.
                    Rapid iteration keeps focus on designing for manufacturability. I also have experience 
                    with CNC milling and laser cutting

                <p>Similar to model rocketry, high power rocketry involves the design, construction, and flight of a
                    rocket.
                    High power rocketry involves higher impulse rocket motors and requires certifications. The
                    engineering skills involved are applicable to many other areas of aerospace.</p>

                    not only in writing firmware for robots and rocket but also in designing the controllers that
                    the firmware goes on.

            <div>
                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>As my first programing language, I've been coding in Python since 2016. With my strong familiarity of
                    it's syntax, functionality, and best practices, I've written quick scripts and desktop applications.
                    Python's fast prototyping speed and numerous scientific and mathematical libraries make it a good
                    choice for many engineering applications.

            <div>
                <h3>C/C++</h3>
                <p>C is the de facto language for embedded and high performance programs. The absence of guard rails
                    necessitates a strong understanding of C concepts such as memory management and pointers as well as
                    objects in C++. I've applied these skills to a variety of applications from the knapsack
                    problem to the firmware for a heat seeking robot.</p>

                <p>The large and complex software systems used in industry need more than just programing skill to
                    write. Software Engineering encompasses the planing and management of the development of complex
                    programs using methods such as Agile development and UML.</p>

                        technical writing. The large amount of papers I've written has developed my ability to write
                        concise and easy to navigate documentation.</p>

                        solved many problems that were beyond my skill set at the time by learning from books, internet
                        sources, and peers.

                        others. My skills extend to both one on one teaching and running workshops. Combined with my
