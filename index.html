                  It is important to plan ahead and set expectations before diving
                  into a challenge.  I strive to ensure everything is as explicit
                  as possible by using tools such as Gantt Charts and by ensureing
                  every task has a person responsible for it to minimize confusion.
                  Doing this ensures I can meet deadlines despite any unanticipated
                  setbacks.  This has been critical to all of my leadership posistions

      				Towards the end of my sophmore year, I joined up with two other
              students to found a NASA Student Launch Initiative Team as a
              subcomitee of the WPI Student Chapter of the AIAA.  While the club
              had competed in rocketry competitions before, Student Launch was
              a far greater challenge.
      			</p>
      			<p class="text-justify">
      				The competition involves designing, testing, and building a rocket
              to fly as close as possible to a target altitude, typically around
              one mile.  After landing, it must deploy a payload to complete a
              specific task such as taking a soil sample.
      			</p>
      			<p class="text-justify">
              To compete, teams must respond to NASA's <abbr title="Request For
              Proposal">RFP</abbr> within the first month of school.  Teams that
              are accepted must complete four design reviews which ussualy take
              the form of 150+ page technical reports followed by a conference
              with NASA.
      			</p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Our first year, I filled the critical role of Safety Officer.  In
              this posistion, I was responsible for minimizing risk to people,
              property, and facilities throughout the entire process.  I also
              managed the project's risk analysis and operation procedures in
              our design reviews.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              This year, I have been appointed Captain.  I'm responsible for
              heading an Officer Board of 9 other Officers and leading the entire
              team consisting of another <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><b>###</b></span> regular Members.  Even before
              the start of the competition, I've set our team up for success by
              creating official procedures and explicit expectations for my
              Officers and Members.  Thanks to the many lessons learned our first
              year, WPI is poised to be a highly competitive team.

            </dl>
            <p class="text-justify">
              In the summer of 2019, I interned at NASA Ames.  My mentor assigned
              me to work on the new HERO Project, which focuses on applications of
              rotorcraft in natural disasters.  Of the two concepts being developed
              for the project, I was appointed Lead for the FireBot group, which
              consisted of two other collage interns and one high school intern,
              and the point of contact for DemoBot, the other group.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              The team was given a simple goal: "Create a concept for a multirotor
              <abbr title="Unmaned Ariel Vehicle">UAV</abbr> that helps fight
              wildland fires and develop a proof-of-concept robot."  We researched
              the problems that wildland fire fighters face to see where UAV
              technology could help.  The problem we selected was extinguishing
              spot fires, small fires created when embers blow over a fire break
              that break the fire's containment if left uncontroled.  Due to their
              small size, it can be hard to find and extinguish them.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Because other groups have already been developing UAVs for locating
              spot fires, we decided to take on the challenge of extinguishing them
              Once a spot fire is located, our concept UAV, FireBot, would be
              dispatched to its location.  After getting close to it by using GPS,
              FireBot finds the fire's exact posistion using <abbr title="Infrared">
              IR</abbr> sensors before deploying its fire suppressant payload
              and returning to its base station. From the base station, it would
              be restocked and recharged before going onto standby until its next
              sortie.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the group constructed
              a low cost, proof-of-concept robot based on Arduino.  It successfully
              completed simulated sorties where it drove to designated coordinates
              before persuing an IR source and deploying suppressant on it.  On
              the group, I was in charge of writing the robot's code, including
              its coordinate navigation, IR tracking, and state machine.

              I had been participating in scouting since I was a child.  Because
              of this, many of my leadership skills I initially learned in scouting.
              During the in 2015, I was elected Senior Patrol Leader, placing me
              in charge of the troop.  While there was an adult Scout Master to
              oversee the troop, the Senior Patrol Leader is responsible for almost
              all of the troop operations.  This includes organizing weekly
              meetings, holding a monthly Patrol Leader's Council with other
              youth leaders to plan events, and running all troop events.

            <p class="text-justify">
              I acheived the rank of Eagle Scout in 2017, something only acomplished by
              6.5% of scouts.<sup>1</sup>  This was the result of seven years of
              hard work and service.  For my Eagle Scout Service Project, a project
              organized and led entirely by the Eagle Scout Candidate, I organized
              the construction of a large raised flower bed for a local elderly home.
              The project took 97.5 volunteer hours to complete and improved the
              life of the residents.  The experience I gained on my way to Eagle
              Scout laid the foundations for many of my future acomplishments.
