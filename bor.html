    <p>Battle of the rockets is a rocketry competition hosted in Virginia. Teams build a <a href="/hpr.html">high power
            rocket</a> to fly to around
        1000 feet before deploying a payload on decent. While teams do present to the BOR Competition Organizers,
        documentation is a focus. Joining one of WPI's two BOR teams was my first introduction to high power rocketry
        and I became friends with Krystina Waters and Caroline Kuhnle, who I would later go on to found WPI's <a
            href="usli.html">USLI Team</a> with. The team performed decently well. Our rocket flew well with only minor
        damage on landing however our rover payload was inoperable due to a failure of the computer the day before.</p>
    <p>I learned a lot about how rockets work and the processes that go into building them and also gained in insight
        into how large design projects could be managed by a team. As a Freshman, this was the first big aerospace
        project I was a part of and helped encourage me to pursue more.</p>
    <p>BOR was a subcommittee of the WPI student branch of the <a href="aiaa.html">AIAA</a> but was dropped in
        2019.</p>
