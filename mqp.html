    <p>I am currently working on my Major Qualifying Project (MQP), WPI's senior capstone project.
        The eight person team that I am on is designing, analyzing, assembling and testing a high power
        model rocket. Our rocket, Andromeda, is more advanced than typical model rockets. After ascending to
        its apogee on a commercial composite solid rocket motor, the first stage and nose cone will be ejected
        and four grid fins will be deployed. Finally, it will undergo an actively stabilized decent before
        completing a propulsive landing using a second stage cold gas thruster.

        I am one of two team members focused on flight dynamics analysis. My focus for the year is to develop a
        6 degrees of freedom vehicle dynamics simulator in MATLAB as well as to design and implement the control
        laws needed for decent and landing. I will likely also help out a bit with the aerodynamic load analysis
        in Ansys Fluent.
    </p>
    <p>
        At this stage of the project, we have completed our preliminary research. I am currently working on
        developing the dynamical simulator. In addition to my primary tasks, I am designing the avionics bay
        and the avionics system that will run the control algorithm in flight.
