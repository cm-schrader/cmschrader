    <p>I am currently working on my Major Qualifying Project (MQP), WPI's senior capstone project.  
        The eight person team that I am on is designing, analyzing, assembling and testing a high power
        model rocket. Our rocket, Andromeda, is more advanced than typical model rockets. After acceding to 
        its apogee on a commercial composite solid rocket motor, the first stage and nose cone will be ejected 
        and four grid fins will be deployed. Finally, it will undergo an actively stabilized decent before 
        completing a propulsive landing using a second stage cold gas thruster.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am one of two team members focused on flight dynamics analysis. My focus for the year is to develop a 
        6 degrees of freedom vehicle dynamics simulator in MATLAB as well as to design and implement the control 
        laws needed for decent and landing. I will likely also help out a bit with the aerodynamic load analysis 
        in Ansys Fluent. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At this stage of the project, we finishing up our preliminary research and concept design. As we finish 
        writing our literature review, we will begin the actual design. I am very excited to get to work writing 
        the vehicle dynamics simulator.
