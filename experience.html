                <p>At GE Aviation, I learned the fundamentals of jet engine propulsion, supply chain management, Six
                    Sigma, and Lean. I applied my skills working on a team to complete a simulated New Product
                    Introduction (NPI) project.

                    wild fire fighting. To do this, systems engineering methods were used to create a concept and
                    firmware was written in C++.

                    and improve drawings, models, and assemblies in Solidworks which I completed 3 weeks ahead of
                    schedule. Additionally, I developed standard procedures for PCB prototyping, and designed and built
                    a vacuum chuck.

                    possible implementation methods and presented our findings.
