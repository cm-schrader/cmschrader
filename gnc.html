        Guidance, Navigation, and Control, often times abbreviated as GNC, is a discipline within aerospace engineering that involves predicting
        and controlling vehicle dynamics.  Guidance involves determining the desired behavior, typically picking your flight path.  Navigation is
        the determination of the current state of the vehicle.  Lastly, control involves determining what actions the vehicle needs to take given
        its current state to follow the desired flight path.  Modern GNC algorithms often rely on computational math and are often simulated in 
        scientific computing languages like <a href="/python.html">Python</a> and <a href="/matlab.html">MATLAB</a>.  They are often implemented on
        <a href="/pcb-design.html">embedded systems</a> to control vehicles enabling things like autopilot and fly-by-wire.
    </p>
    <p>
        As my favorite discipline within aerospace engineering, I've taken a number of courses in this subject.  Most notably, the course Guidance, 
        Navigation, and Communication as well as Spacecraft Dynamics and Control.  By the end of this school year, I will have completed my last undergraduate 
        course in the subject, Aircraft Dynamics and Control, and some graduate courses like Optimal Control and Applied Machine Learning.

    <h5>Dynamics</h5>
    <p>
        More often then not, the motion of dynamical systems like spacecraft cannot be described with simple functions.  Typically, these systems are modeled
        using systems of differential equations that, in many situations, are non-linear.  These are impossible to solve with algebra and require the use of
        numerical solvers.  Throughout many of my courses, I've built dynamical simulators to model systems from differential drive robots to rockets.  I've used 
        a variety of tools for this such as <a href="/matlab.html">MATLAB's</a> built in ODE solvers as well as algorithms I've implemented myself like RK4 and RKF45.

    <h5>Kalman Filter</h5>
    <p>
        One of the primary challenges of navigation is that real sensors don't produce perfect data.  There is always some noise that, if not accounted for, can
        throw control algorithms way off.  Much of my experience working with navigation has been in my GNC course, primarily designing Kalman filters.  The Kalman
        filter is a state estimation algorithm that fuses multiple noisy sensor readings and a mathematical model of the system and was first implemented on the 
        Apollo Guidance Computer.  There are other variants of the filter that address different types of systems such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF) which
        is used for nonlinear dynamical systems that the regular Kalman filter doesn't work on.
        Over the course of my GNC class, I implemented various kalman filters in <a href="/matlab.html">MATLAB</a>
        ranging from simple ones for estimating the state of a particle moving in one dimension
        to an EKF to estimate the flight path of an airplane in 3D space using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System" target="_blank">WGS84</a>.

    <p class="caption">A graph showing the results of an extended Kalman filter I implemented for an aircraft.  While both the real flight path (the ground truth) 
        and the path estimated by the EKF are graphed, they appear as one because of just how accurate the EKF's estimates are.
