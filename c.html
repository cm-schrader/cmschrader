    <div class="large-br"></div>
    <p>C, and its object oriented superset C++, are low level languages used in instances when high performance or the
        need to run in embedded systems is required. Programing high level languages, like <a
            href="/python.html">Python</a>, is great for short development times and intuitive code, but there are many
        times when you need to work close to the metal and with fine control over every aspect of your program. C can
        run on just about any chip and lets programers manage <i>everything</i>. C++ adds some higher level concepts
        such as objects.</p>
    <p>C's control and speed comes at the cost of guard rails. Full control means that anything compiles goes even if
        that program will cause memory leaks and segmentation faults. This leaves it up to the
        programmer to find cryptic bugs and avoid "footguns". Because of this, it is critical that C programers have a
        deep understanding of the language.</p>
    <p>I learned C and C++ in my Introduction to Systems Programing course. The course taught about concepts like
        pointers and memory management that helped me to attain that critical understanding. I further expanded my
        skills
        in my Algorithms course where I coded in C++. I have used C++ on many occasions for programing Arduinos and
        other similar dev boards for both personal projects and at internships. Most recently, I have been learning how
        to use <abbr title="Real Time Operating System">RTOS</abbr> and HAL to program my STM32 based flight computer.
