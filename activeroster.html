    <p>When I was elected as Captain of USLI, one of the things I wanted to do was create a better system for tracking
        member attendance on the team. While the team had a criteria for who qualifies as an active member, it was hard
        to tell who met them and subsequently it was hard to tell the exact size of the team along with who qualifies to
        attend competition. I wasn't interested in managing a massive spreadsheet tracking every event, so I did some
        research. As is often the case, I didn't find any software that was an <i>exact</i> match for what I was looking
        for so I decided to take it on as a summer project.</p>
    <p>The end result was ActiveRoster, a Python program designed to track members attendance at USLI events and
        automatically determine their member status. Despite there being a couple bugs when I rolled it out at the
        beggining of the year, they were soon fixed and it was able to do its job effetivley.</p>
    <p>I learned a lot in the process. In order to sync between computers, it utilized a cloud database, the first time
        I had done so. I also learned about distributing Python programs, which was more difficult than I expected.</p>
    <p>In the time since writting it, I've learned more and reflected on ActiveRoster. In retrospect, my implimentation
        of the database didn't follow best practices and the GUI also looks somewhat dated which was a somewhat
        inevitable
        effect of using the Tkinter Library. I hope to eventually find time go back and revisit the program.
