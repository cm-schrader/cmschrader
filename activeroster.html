        <h2>ActiveRoster</h2>
        <p>
            When I was elected as Captain of <a href="usli.html">HPRC</a>, one
            of the things I wanted to do was create a better system for tracking
            member attendance on the team. While the team had a criteria for who
            qualifies as an active member, it was hard to tell who met them and
            subsequently it was hard to tell the exact size of the team along
            with who qualifies to attend competition. I wasn't interested in
            managing a massive spreadsheet tracking every event, so I did some
            research. As is often the case, I didn't find any software that was
            an <i>exact</i> match for what I was looking for so I decided to
            take it on as a summer project.
        </p>
        <p>
            The end result was ActiveRoster, a Python program designed to track
            members attendance at HPRC events and automatically determine their
            member status. Once a member in the system, all they had to do was
            swipe their student ID to be counted at an event. Despite there
            being a couple bugs when I rolled it out at the beginning of the
            year, they were soon fixed and it was able to do its job
            effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned a lot in the process. In order to sync between computers,
            it utilized Google Firebase which was my first time using a cloud
            database. I also learned about distributing Python programs, which
            was more difficult than I expected.
        </p>
        <h2>ActiveRoster2</h2>
        <p>
            In the time since I wrote ActiveRoster, I learned more about
            databases and <a href="agile.html">software engineering</a>. Looking
            back, I've realized that the ActiveRoster database implementation
            broke some best practice rules. There were also a few officers who
            were reluctant to learn a new program. Because of this, and a couple
            smaller items issues, I hoped to revisit the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the team prepared for the 2020-21 competition year, we had to
            transition to a virtual workflow. Because of this, swiping student
            IDs was no longer an option. I decided to revisit the project to
            create something that would accommodate this. I also wanted to
            simplify the program. While packing a program with features has
            taught me a lot about programing in the past, I've learned that
            often times users just want something intuitive with well polished
            core features.
        </p>
        <p>
            The team was using MS Teams for video meetings, which is able to
            generate attendance reports. I decided to, instead of managing my
            own database of members, utilize these reports. This meant that in
            writing the new program, I could completely eliminate the database.
            Member credentials and check in were managed by MS Teams and the
            reports were just stored on the team's file repository which had the
            side affect of creating a simple workflow for officers.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the end, ActiveRoster2 is only 124 lines of code, 91% smaller
            than the original ActiveRoster. Offloading functionality to familiar
            applications we already used helped to prevent users from being
            overwhelmed by needing to learn a new program and prevented me from
            "reinventing the wheel". Sometimes a compact and efficient design is
            all you really need.
