        <h3 class="subtitle">Aerospace Engineering Intern, Summer 2018</h3>
    </span>
    <div class="small-br"></div>
    <p>In 2018, I was hired as one of 3 interns at Busek, a small company that makes electrical propulsion systems for
        spacecraft and other similar systems. My time at Busek was was split between working with the Design Group and
        the Electrical Group.</p>
    <h3>Design Group</h3>
    <p>In the design group, I primarily worked with Solidworks and Solidworks PDM to complete a variety of tasks.
        Initially, I started off
        doing some relativley simple reformating of a group of engineering drawrings to conform to the companies current
        design standards. Throught the summer, the work got more involved. Many of my tasks ivolved revising parts,
        assemblies, and drawrings to improve manufacturability. I often worked with other engineers and vedors to solve
        these problems. Some other tasks I did included doing inventory managment in Excel and building an electrical
        filter.</p>
    <h3>Electrical Group</h3>
    <p>Before coming to Busek, I had never taken any electrical courses beyond introductory physics. Despite this, I was
        able to learn a lot from a variety of sources in order to contribute. My work there primarily focused on Printed
        Circuit Board (PCB) prototyping. </p>
    <h5>PCB Prototyping</h5>
    <p>The Electrical Group had a small desktop CNC machine on which I learned how to CNC mill double and single sided
        circuit board. I also setup a easy method for applying soulder mask and tinning the pads to create finished
        boards. After finishing this, I created detailed procedures to guide other engineers through the entire process
        from gerber files to finished PCB. My efforts helped to accelerate the prototyping process allowing.</p>

    <p class="caption">FR1 blank fixtured using the vacuum chuck.</p>
    <h5>Vacuum Chuck</h5>
    <p>One of the issues with CNC mill was that the only fixturing option we had for the FR1 blanks was double sided
        tape. This was time consuming to apply and often lead to warping when trying to remove it which was problematic
        for 2 sided boards. After doing some research, I proposed creatinga vacuum chuck, a plate which fixtures the
        blank using vacuum force. After going through several iterations of design, I manufactured the design out of
        aluminum which I machined on the CNC itself. Once installed on the mill and connected to a shop vacuum, the FR1
        blanks could be easily positioned with the built in alighnment bracket and fixtured by turning the vacuum on.
        This is quicker and essier than using double sided tape, wastes no materials, and doesn't damage the board. Last
        I heard, it is still in use and has made working with the mill much essier.
    </p>
    <h5 id="current">Current Meter Reader</h5>
    <p>One of the other two interns was working on a current meter specifically designed for some hardware tests other
        engineers needed to run. I was assigned to create an desktop program to interface with it. I wrote a bit of C++
        on the firmware side to send the data that was read over ethernet. From there, I created a desktop application
        in Python to read the data and display it in real time. The gui library used was Tkinter along with Matplotlib
        for graphing. Multithreading was used to manage the receiving of data from the current meter while
        simsimultaneously graphing it. The program also had some other featuers such as the ability to export data,
        compute linear regressions on the graph, and detect times of interest. </p>
