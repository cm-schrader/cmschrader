    <p>Over the years, I've grown a diverse skill set but I don't know how to solve every problem. As the field of
        aerospace constantly advances, there is no way for an engineer to know everything. For this reason, it is
        important to be able to fully utilize your resources, such as papers, peers, textbooks, and online material, to
        learn new skills. Being able to do this efficiently
        helps to minimize the time spent gaining knowledge and maximizing your time applying it.</p>
    <p>Efficient learning has been vital to my academic success at in WPI's fast paced 7 week terms. I've also applied
        this to help me succeed when facing problems beyond my current skill set and sometimes not even in my field.
        During my internship at <a href="/busek.html">Busek</a>, half of my time was spent with the Electrical Group, a
        field outside the Aerospace and Computer Science courses I've taken. Despite this, I was able to swiftly learn
        new things and complete several projects. </p>
    <p>
        More recently, I've continued my self learning in electronics.  Over the course of about a month in the summer of 2020,
        I managed to learn PCB design and create my own flight controller.  While the internet is bursting with tutorials for 
        things like <a href="/python.html">python</a> and <a href="/c.html">arduino</a>, resources on embedded systems are more 
        limited.  Despite this, I was able to find what guides I could and pick up the rest of the details from datasheets.
