    <p>The National Association of Rocketry (NAR) offers High Power Rocketry certifications for members who fulfill
        requirements. Three levels of certification, each authorizing a member to purchase and launch higher impulse
        rocket motors. </p>
    <p>I got my Level 1 certification in 2018. To do this, I had to build and fly a rocket using a motor within the
        level 1 range (160 to 640 Newton seconds) and recover it undamaged. I built a relatively simple rocket which
        flew successfully leading to my certification.</p>
    <p>To achieve a Level 2 certification, a member must first pass a written test before successfully flying and
        recovering a rocket using a motor within the level 2 range (640 to 2560 Newton seconds). For this, I built the
        Sepetron, named after the smallest solid rocket booster in Kerbal Space Program. It uses a flight computer to
        deploy parachutes along with some 3D printed components.</p>

    <p class="caption">I look over the rocket and my flight simulation report one last time as I fill out flight
        paperwork just before launch. Solstice, <a href="/usli.html">USLI's</a> 2020 subscale rocket, was launched the
        same day and can be seen being assembled in the background.</p>
    <p>I initially flew the Sepatron in early 2020. While I passed the written test, the upper airframe bulkhead broke
        leading to a loss of the upper airframe. Because of school, I had to put the project on hold. Now that I have
        had time to fix the problems, I will fly again next chance I get to go to a launch.</p>
