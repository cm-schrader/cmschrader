    <p>Printed circuit boards allow complex electrical systems to be built on a compact and light weight board. Like
        many other engineers, my first experience with electrical systems was with Arduino. While it is an excellent way
        to learn, you can only get so far using a bread board.</p>
    <p>My first experiences with printed circuit boards happened as part of my work at Busek. As part of my work in the
        Electrical Group, I learned Eagle and the basics of LTspice. While I designed a few simple boards, most of my
        work focused on their construction. Through building quite a few myself, I picked up not only soldering and
        reflow skills, but also knowledge of how PCBs are built and the technology behind them.

    <h3>Flight Computer</h3>
    <p>For a while, I went back to using dev boards like the Arduino and Teensy 3.2. In Spring of 2020 I decided to
        start
        on building my own flight computer for <a href="/hpr.html">high power rockets</a>. I initially started building
        a system on a breadboard using a Teensy 3.2 but found myself unsatisfied. Breadboard systems take up a lot of
        space and are not very permanent. I also wanted something more robust than the Arduino Environment to program
        in. This lead me to spend several weeks researching a PCB solution. </p>

    <p>Using a variety of datasheets and educational resources, I was able to design Carbon-X1, a new flight computer
        powered by an STM32, a popular 32 bit microcontroller. I finished assembly and board diagnostics which
        has demonstrated that my design functions well. I will eventually write
        a page about this project, but in the meantime, you can see the firmware repository on
        <a href="https://github.com/cm-schrader/Nucleon" target="blank">Github</a>.
