    <p>Rapid Prototyping includes a number of technologies and skills that enable a number of prototypes for a design to
        be built quickly allowing for quick iteration and the discovery of flaws early on. </p>
    <h3>3D Printing</h3>
    <p>3D Printing, otherwise known as additive manufacturing, is a process in which an object is built up layer by
        layer. This technology allows low volumes of parts with complex geometry to be built quick and cheap. I was
        first introduced to it high school when me and two other students competed in the Brandeis
        Printathon where we won 3rd place. Since then, I've started a MakerSpace at my high school, built and upgraded
        two printers for myself, and utilized the technology for a variety of projects.</p>
    <p>One instance that exemplifies the utility of 3D Printing occurred when <a href="/usli.html">USLI</a> purchased a
        large 75 mm motor casing for our 2020 rocket. CTI, the manufacturer, recommends purchasing a special
        wrench for assembling the system. The wrench, which can be seen <a
            href="https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket_Motors/Cesaroni_Casings/75mm_Closures/Cesaroni_Pro75_Wrench">here</a>,
        is $56.20. Rather than spend team budget, I decided to take the evening to design my own wrench. After measuring
        the dimensions of the wring, I made a few prototypes to dial in the tolerances. Satisfied with the results, I
        added a knurled grip and printed it over night. The final cost was less than $1 in plastic and worked well. If
        you want to see the design or print your own, you can download it below.</p>

    <h3>CNC Milling</h3>
    <p>3D Printing is useful in many situations, but it is limited by material options. Computer Numerical Control
        (CNC) Milling allows for the machining various materials including metals. I have experience in using this
        technology to fabricate printed circuit boards and metal components. Most of my CAM work has been done in Fusion
        360's CAM Workspace. Beyond some simpler parts, such as a bulkhead for <a href="/usli.html">USLI</a>, my best
        components were done during my time at <a href="/busek.html">Busek</a>.</p>
